# Handoff

For the next conversation on this repository. Read this, then
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) (what is done and left; keep it current),
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) (how parity is built and
checked), [docs/bugs.md](docs/bugs.md) (the original game's bugs),
[docs/presentation.md](docs/presentation.md) (60+ fps and 4K) and
[docs/repeated-processes.md](docs/repeated-processes.md) (every process we run
more than once, what it costs). State as of 12 October 2026.

This file is kept short on purpose: it holds only the current state and
standing practice, not a session-by-session log. Earlier sessions' detail
(what was tried, what failed, exact investigation narratives) is in
`git log -p handoff.md` — it does not need to live here to stay available.

## Current state

Last fully gated runtime baseline: VGAME `0000:BCEF` camera-image pass,
commit `2fa6695`, 822 matched addresses. Full gate
`D:/f117-gate/gate-camimage.log` passes: 47 unit tests, all 40 routes (40
fresh interpreter sessions), both instruction profiles and three matched
seeds, with reachability/event checks, 1,480 s. Census is 814 functions /
78,497 bytes (P2 46.61%, overall 75.71%). Prior moving-object baseline/
evidence is pushed as `e9aa11a`.

A rotating matched seed at this same gate run (`0x2fa6695118ca`) exposed a
stack-aliasing bug in the already-matched map projection (`VGAME 0000:13B9`,
`vgame_map_project`, not the new camera code): it cached its `y`/`py` stack
arguments up front where the original reads them late, after a store that
can land on either argument's own stack slot when DS and SS alias in a
fuzzed state - the same bug class as `vgame_eventlog_add`. Fixed by
declining whenever the store could overlap either slot; regression
`matched_map_project_stack_alias` retains the seed. Re-gated clean:
`D:/f117-gate/gate-map-project-fix.log`, 47 tests, all 40 routes, both
instruction profiles and three matched seeds, 1,480 s (build 94, coverage
584, regeneration 25, parity 777).

A sibling handler, **VGAME 0FB2:04DD** (the line clipper's own divide-error
handler), is matched and fixture-proven but deliberately **not integrated**:
exhaustive search (all 39 routes, three new staged flight scripts, an
instrumented probe logging 146,153 real clip divisions across 14 routes)
found no input that overflows it — every caller's line length is bounded
well under the 32,767-unit threshold that would trigger it. It is preserved,
not lost: local branch `irq-divide-fault` (commit `e15c9ef`, cherry-pickable
onto any future `master`) and patch file
`D:/f117-gate/next-drafts/irq-divide-fault/0002-match-clip-divide-fault-04DD-lockstep-only.patch`.
Integrate it only if a route (or a deliberately staged, clearly-labeled
non-normal-play input) is found that actually reaches it — fixture-only
proof is not sufficient for this project (see "How this project verifies
Phase 2 work" below).

## Next up

- **Gate speed experiment completed; retain `--jobs 16`.** The full
  24-worker gate at `7df74bf` passes with identical inputs and verdicts,
  but coverage/parity take 557/830 s against the latest same-code
  16-worker baseline's 538/822 s. Its 1,455 s total versus 1,546 s comes
  from the faster incremental build, not faster routes. The earlier
  1,466 s baseline had 809 addresses; it is not the direct comparator.
  Proof and limits: [docs/repeated-processes.md](docs/repeated-processes.md).
  `D:/f117-gate/affinity_launch.py` now sets and verifies `BelowNormal`
  priority as well as affinity; workers were verified to inherit both.
- Continue Phase 2 (naming/matching routines) — `tools/reimp_names.py` has
  the private lead list; current progress is in `docs/roadmap.md`, which
  has the full history of integrated-and-gated passes (span-edge/emit, HUD,
  moving objects, camera-image). Earlier proofs and tested source snapshots
  remain under `D:/f117-gate/`; history is in
  [docs/repeated-processes.md](docs/repeated-processes.md).
  Next dossier: `D:/f117-gate/flight-input`, VGAME `0000:1EB0`
  (`vgame_flight_input`), 1,274 instructions / 3,543 bytes / 121 calls.
  Partial external named draft `named-flight-input.c` (parts 1-10) covers
  initialization, keyboard collection, command dispatch, modal quit/blank
  pauses, raw axis scaling, nonlinear controls, altitude hold, trim and
  low-speed recovery **through `2A17`** (not `23B4` — that was this
  routine's state two sessions ago; it has since grown past ejection
  dynamics, thrust and position/rotation integration). Uninserted and
  untested. `semantics-notes.md` in the same folder records variable
  identities cross-referenced from already-matched code (heading `2DEE`,
  pitch `2DF0`, roll `2DF2`, throttle `2E0A`, thrust `B19C`, speed `B07E`,
  height `2DF4`, ground level `C0CE`, position accumulators
  `BA3C:BA3E`/`C056:C058`, far sin/cos/fixmul at `104E:76`/`66`/`0`) —
  read it before continuing so that work isn't repeated. Remaining:
  the `2A17`-`2C86` segment (position integration, landing/crash checks,
  history) needs hand-naming, then the whole routine wired in as a
  candidate and run through both verification tiers before it can be
  called matched — semantic plausibility alone is not enough (this
  session's map_project fix above is a reminder why).
- 04DD above, if a real route to it is ever found.

## How this project verifies Phase 2 work (read before matching a new routine)

A routine only counts as matched once it passes BOTH:
1. **Fixture/lockstep proof**: `func_lockstep` at three seeds, comparing the
   hand-written C against the original's own bytes from randomized (and for
   routines with real argument/driver dependencies, returning-driver-thunk)
   entry states. Zero mismatches required.
2. **Real-driver proof**: an actual scripted route (`tools/routes/*.args`, sometimes replaying `.input`)
   must execute the routine with a positive count, with every checkpoint and
   the final hash identical between engines. Fixture proof alone is not
   enough — this project has repeatedly found routines that pass every
   fixture seed but were never proven reachable by real play (see this
   session's 04DD, and the historical pattern in `docs/repeated-processes.md`
   and `docs/roadmap.md`). If you can't find a route that reaches a new
   routine, say so plainly and keep it out of `master`, same as 04DD above.

Every change to `src/matched/matched.c` needs a fresh full gate
(`py tools/build_recomp.py --data D:/GOG/F-117A --seed-coverage
C:/Users/Tideg/f117-recomp-local/coverage --jobs 16 --verify-interp-cache`,
via `D:/f117-gate/affinity_launch.py`, ~24 min) before it's pushed. Read the
actual tally in the log, not just the exit code.

## Where things are

- Game install: `D:/GOG/F-117A` (never mounted or written directly by a
  tool; copy per run that needs its own state).
- Shared generated code: `C:/Users/Tideg/f117-recomp-local/gen` (never
  committed); coverage in `...\coverage`; route run outputs in `...\runs`.
- Private worktree `C:/Users/Tideg/f117-recomp-local/wt`: contains
  uncommitted draft work from well before this session (base commit
  `01f4dbd`, far behind current `master`) **plus unrelated older
  presentation-layer drafts**. Never copy it wholesale or regenerate from
  it — extract only the specific routine(s) you're integrating, rebuilt
  against current `master`, the way this session's 084E/04DD extraction did.
- `D:/f117-gate/next-drafts/`: private draft sources and patches, never
  committed as-is.
- Scratch/capture data that used to be scattered across `D:\f117-*` loose
  folders and `C:\Users\Tideg\f117-local` is now consolidated under
  `D:\F117A-Scratch-Files` (moved there 11-12 Oct 2026, nothing deleted).
  Git worktrees under `D:\f117-wt` are removed once their branch is merged
  into `master` (`git worktree remove`) — their content lives on in git
  history, not on disk.
- Other, unproven private drafts mentioned in earlier sessions (VGAME
  `120A:0971`, a different divide-handling routine with recursive-fault
  risk; END `0A98`): none
  implemented or proven. Don't conflate them with the routines above.

## Standing practice

- **No AI attribution** in commits or PRs — the user's own global CLAUDE.md
  rule outranks any harness reminder that asks for a trailer.
- **Commit and push together**: don't leave a validated commit unpushed.
  Commit titles start with `py tools/progress.py --title`'s scoreboard line.
- **Public repo, code only.** No game data, no generated C, no raw
  captures/logs, no private-project references (see `docs/provenance.md`'s
  de-identified framing of an earlier private project this one is partly
  ported from — don't re-add its name or path).
- Check system load (`Get-Counter '\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time'`,
  or similar) before stacking a second heavy parallel job; a background
  Python `multiprocessing.Pool`'s workers are children of the script, not of
  the task wrapper, so stopping the task doesn't kill them — find and kill
  the process tree if one needs to go.
- Prefer moving stale-but-maybe-useful local data to a scratch folder over
  deleting it outright; it's outside git and not undoable.
- The owner is not a software engineer: explain trade-offs plainly, flag
  overengineering, keep docs accurate without bloat (this file's own trim,
  12 Oct 2026, is an example — consolidate instead of appending forever).
